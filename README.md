### Hi, I'm Tom ðŸ‘‹

I'm a researcher building AI tools for monitoring and adapting to climate change.
I apply ML algorithms to large datasets from climate simulations, satellites, and in-situ stations to reveal scientific insights and support decision-making.

I believe both engineering and theory are vital for scaling AI applications into real-world impact, and I try to cultivate this in my own work.
(I'm still trying to work out if I'm a scientist who's secretly an engineer or an engineer who's secretly a scientist!)

While you're here, you might like to check out some of my projects:
* :computer: [DeepSensor](https://github.com/tom-andersson/deepsensor), a Python package for modelling `xarray` and `pandas` with neural processes to tackle diverse environmental prediction tasks (and a gallery of demonstrators [here](https://github.com/tom-andersson/deepsensor_demos)).
* :snowflake: [IceNet](https://github.com/tom-andersson/icenet-paper), a codebase for reproducing our [*Nature Communications* paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25257-4) on seasonal Arctic sea ice forecasting with deep learning. IceNet is in the process of being operationalised over at [icenet-ai](https://github.com/icenet-ai)!

Feel free to reach out through my contact details on the left.
